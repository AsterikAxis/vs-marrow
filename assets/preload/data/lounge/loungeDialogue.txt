:gf:Phew! That was a close call dear!
:bfOfucc:*panting*
:bfOfucc:God damn, I'm so beat!
:bfNervous:How are you not tired of running on heels for like a mile or two?
:gf:It's a secret, hehe~
:gfSmiling:Anyway, we made it in, and hopefully we're going to get there on time.
:marrowFriendly:Hello there, tickets please.
:gfHappy:Oh sure!, We have them right here..
:gfSad:Wait,
:gf:Marrow?
:marrowSuspicious:...
:marrowConfused:Miss G?
:bfSuprised:Oh crap! You know this bone dude?
:marrowFriendly:Of course, she used to be a regular on taking my train.
:marrowConfused:It's been like what, a year maybe?
:gf:Yeah.
:gfSmiling:I haven't really had a reason to take the train until now.
:marrow:Oh,
:marrowHappy:well it's a pleasure to see you
:marrowFriendly:Speaking of which, you're Miss G's new partner, right?
:bf:Yeah, I am. The name's BF! Nice to meet you Marrow!
:marrowHappy:Same here!
:marrowFriendly:But anyways, I'm going to need your tickets.
:bf:Oh sure, let me grab them from my pocket.
:bf:...
:bf:uhh...
:bfOfucc:uh oh...
:gfSad:...
:gfSad:Sweetie, you didn't forget our tickets, did you?
:bfNervous:I-I'm sure they're in... my other pocket..
:bfNervous:...
:bfOfucc:..c-crap....
:marrow:...
:marrowConfused:You don't have your tickets, do you?
:gfCrying:BF! How could you forget our tickets!
:bfNervous:I swore I put them in my pocket babe!
:bfOfucc:I think...
:marrow:Regardless of where they might be, if I don't get your tickets,
:marrowPissed:I'm going to have to ask you to get off the train.
:gfSad:Can you please let us slide just this once?
:bfNervous:We really have somewhere to be right now and we can't show up late!
:marrowConfused:Hmm..
:marrowConfused:Let's see...
:marrowConfused:Wait, BF. You've beaten her ex-rockstar father in a rap battle, right?
:bf:Been there, done that... And I would gladly do it again!
:marrowHappy:Then you wouldn't turn down a rap battle from me right?
:bf:Of course not! I've rapped against many dudes.. some almost killed me and GF!
:gfSmiling:Haha, yeah!
:gf:But you kicked their ass in the end.
:marrowFriendly:Interesting...
:marrowSuspicious:Even though that's mildly concerning...
:marrowSuspicious:...
:marrowHappy:Anyways, if you can best me out of three, I might just turn a blind eye to the lack of tickets.
:bfSuprised:What?? Really?! Alright!
:gfHappy:Thank you so much!
:gf:I'm sorry we forgot our tickets,
:gfSmiling:But I promise we'll pay you back!
:bf:Well, what're we waitin' for?!
:bf:Let's funk!
:marrowFriendly:You're a real confident kid.
:marrowHappy:I like that confidence.
